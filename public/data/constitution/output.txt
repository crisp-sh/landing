The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of **checks and balances** between the **legislative** (Congress) and **executive** (President) branches to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. Here's how the system works, with three historical examples:

### üîÅ **Checks and Balances in the Constitution**

1. **Legislative on Executive**  
   - **Lawmaking:** Congress writes and passes laws (Article I, Section 7), but the President can **veto** them.  
   - **Override Power:** Congress can **override a veto** with a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate.  
   - **Appointments and Treaties:** The Senate must approve the President‚Äôs **treaty agreements** and **appointments** (Article II, Section 2).  
   - **Impeachment:** The House can **impeach** the President, and the Senate can **try and remove** him (Article I, Sections 2‚Äì3).

2. **Executive on Legislative**  
   - **Veto Power:** The President can **reject bills** passed by Congress (Article I, Section 7).  
   - **Calling Special Sessions:** The President can **convene or adjourn** Congress in certain cases (Article II, Section 3).  
   - **State of the Union:** The President can recommend legislation through the **State of the Union** address (Article II, Section 3).

### üìú **Historical Examples**

#### 1. **Andrew Johnson‚Äôs Impeachment (1868)**
Congress clashed with President Johnson over Reconstruction policies. The House impeached him for violating the **Tenure of Office Act**, and though the Senate narrowly acquitted him, the case showed Congress checking presidential power.

#### 2. **Nixon‚Äôs Veto of the War Powers Resolution (1973)**
President Nixon vetoed a law limiting his power to send U.S. forces abroad without congressional approval. Congress **overrode** the veto, asserting its role in foreign military action.

#### 3. **Senate Rejection of the Treaty of Versailles (1919)**
Although President Wilson negotiated the treaty to end World War I, the Senate **refused to ratify** it, demonstrating its constitutional check on foreign agreements.

### üß† Summary

The Constitution's checks and balances ensure that while the President leads the executive branch, Congress holds significant power over legislation, spending, appointments, and even removal from office. These mechanisms maintain a balance crucial to the U.S. system of government.
