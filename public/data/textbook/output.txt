The user is asking for a summary of Chapter 5 on stereochemistry, broken down by subchapter (like 5.1 for Enantiomers and 5.2 for Chirality), and some practice problems to help them study for their test. I'll summarize each subchapter in a concise 1-2 sentence paragraph, then come up with a few practice problems for each one—probably about 1-3 problems per subchapter, totaling around 10 problems. It’s a practical request, so it should be straightforward!

The user has requested a structured, concise chapter summary using markdown. Each subchapter, such as "5.1 Enantiomers and the Tetrahedral Carbon," will have a brief summary followed by one practice problem. The practice questions will focus on key concepts. Since the user is preparing for a test, we should aim for clarity and conciseness, using well-defined headings, with potentially no more than 12 questions—one per subchapter—based on their preference.

I’ll work on keeping it breezy yet structured!

Done
Here’s a section-by-section recap plus one targeted problem per topic to test your grasp before the exam.

5.1 Enantiomers and the Tetrahedral Carbon
Summary:

When an sp³ carbon is bonded to four different groups, its two mirror images cannot be superimposed.

Such non-superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers.

Practice Problem:
Draw the Lewis structures of lactic acid’s two enantiomers (– and +). Show why they can’t be superimposed.

5.2 The Reason for Handedness in Molecules: Chirality
Summary:

A molecule is chiral if it has no plane of symmetry and is not identical to its mirror image.

Achiral molecules either lack tetrahedral stereocenters or possess an internal mirror plane.

Practice Problem:
Decide whether methylcyclohexane and 2-methylcyclohexanone are chiral or achiral. Explain based on symmetry or substituent differences.

5.3 Optical Activity
Summary:

Chiral molecules rotate plane-polarized light; dextrorotatory (+) to the right, levorotatory (–) to the left.

The observed rotation scales with concentration and pathlength; the specific rotation [α]ᴰ normalizes these variables.

Practice Problem:
A sample of sucrose ( [α]ᴰ = +66.47 ) at 0.50 g/mL in a 2.0 dm cell gives what observed rotation?

5.4 Pasteur’s Discovery of Enantiomers
Summary:

Pasteur separated “right-handed” and “left-handed” tartrate crystals by hand, showing mirror-image forms with opposite optical rotations.

This was the first resolution of a racemic mixture into pure enantiomers.

Practice Problem:
Explain why a 1:1 mixture of (+)- and (–)-tartaric acid shows no net rotation, yet the separated crystals do.

5.5 Sequence Rules for Specifying Configuration
Summary:

The Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rules rank substituents by atomic number, isotopic mass, and then by successive atoms.

With the lowest-priority group pointed away, the 1→2→3 path is clockwise → R, counterclockwise → S.

Practice Problem:
Assign R or S to both enantiomers of 2-chlorobutane.

5.6 Diastereomers
Summary:

Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images (they differ at one or more but not all stereocenters).

Unlike enantiomers, diastereomers have different physical properties.

Practice Problem:
List the stereochemical relationship between (2R,3R)- and (2R,3S)-2-amino-3-hydroxybutanoic acid.

5.7 Meso Compounds
Summary:

Meso compounds have stereocenters but are overall achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

They do not exhibit optical activity despite having chirality centers.

Practice Problem:
Show why meso-tartaric acid is superimposable on its mirror image, whereas 2R,3R- and 2S,3S-tartaric acids are not.

5.8 Racemic Mixtures and the Resolution of Enantiomers
Summary:

A racemate is a 1:1 mix of enantiomers (optically inactive).

Resolution often uses chiral reagents (e.g., chiral amine salts) to form separable diastereomeric salts.

Practice Problem:
Outline how (R)-1-phenylethylamine resolves racemic lactic acid into separable salts.

5.9 A Review of Isomerism
Summary:

Constitutional isomers differ in connectivity; stereoisomers share connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement.

Stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, cis-trans isomers, epimers, etc.

Practice Problem:
Classify each pair as constitutional isomers, enantiomers, or diastereomers:

Butane vs. isobutane

(S)-lactic acid vs. (R)-lactic acid

cis-1,3-dimethylcyclopentane vs. trans-1,3-dimethylcyclopentane

5.10 Chirality at Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur
Summary:

Trivalent N inverts too fast to isolate enantiomers, but phosphines and sulfonium salts can be configurationally stable.

Coenzyme S-adenosylmethionine is a natural, chiral sulfonium salt.

Practice Problem:
Explain why ethylmethylamine is not isolable as enantiomers, but (R)-methylpropylphenylphosphine can be.

5.11 Prochirality
Summary:

An sp² center is prochiral if attack on one face (Re or Si) yields different enantiomers.

An sp³ center is prochiral if replacing one of two identical groups creates a stereocenter (pro-R vs. pro-S).

Practice Problem:
Identify the Re and Si faces of 2-butanone and predict which face attack gives (R)-2-butanol.

5.12 Chirality in Nature and Chiral Environments
Summary:

Biological receptors are chiral, so only one enantiomer of a drug typically fits.

Even achiral substrates become “distinguished” in a chiral environment (enzyme active site).

Practice Problem:
R-ibuprofen is inactive analgesically but slowly converts to S inside the body. Propose how a chiral environment (enzyme) might favor that conversion.

Keep these summaries handy, work through each practice question, and you’ll be ready for any stereochemistry challenge on test day. Good luck!
