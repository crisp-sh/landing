**Top Three Weaknesses**

1. **Melodramatic Tone**  
   The language leans toward clichés and overly dramatic imagery (e.g., “the red in every thermometer started to fall,” “the unexpected news rammed my heart”), which can distract from the genuine emotions you want to convey.

2. **Structural Redundancy**  
   The essay revisits the same ideas—feeling isolated, quitting activities, then resuming them—without clear turning points or concrete details to anchor each stage of your journey.

3. **Clarity and Specificity**  
   References like “Ron” and broad statements about “activities” lack context. Admissions readers will remember vivid details: where you lived, exactly what you did, and how those experiences changed you.

**Rewritten Essay**

It was a gray November afternoon in Yekaterinburg, Russia, when my phone buzzed with a video call from home. My mother’s face was drawn and pale. With a voice barely above a whisper, she told me my parents were separating. In that moment, miles of snow and language barriers dissolved into one heavy silence: I was utterly alone.

In the days that followed, I stopped speaking Russian beyond the bare minimum. I skipped my evening chess club, let basketball drills collect dust, and ignored my piano lessons. My host family’s kind questions went unanswered; I felt trapped inside a bubble of grief I couldn’t puncture. Every tear reminded me that I was helpless and far from the only student living abroad—but I had never felt so powerless.

Then, one Sunday morning, I caught sight of a children’s chess tournament poster pinned to the community center door. I remembered why I fell in love with the game: the thrill of anticipating an opponent’s next move, the satisfaction of a well-timed sacrifice. That afternoon, I dusted off my board and began practicing again. A week later, I laced up my sneakers for open gym, and the following weekend, I sat at my piano to master a Chopin nocturne.

Re-engaging with these familiar challenges was like finding oxygen. In a local chess tournament, I won my first game against a seasoned player; on the court, I scored my first three-pointer in Russian; at my recital, my hands no longer trembled. Slowly, I realized that my host city—famous for its ballet and scientific institutes—offered more than new scenery. It offered me the chance to redefine myself outside my parents’ story.

Today, I appreciate that hardship can sharpen our focus instead of dimming it. Living abroad during my parents’ divorce taught me resilience: to find strength in routines, to connect across cultures, and to turn solitude into self-discovery. I returned home not just older, but more confident—ready to face whatever comes next with an open heart and a determined mind.
